        Kitty couldn't believe it was a <b>machine</b> -- a huge glass sphere floating above the city, it took up as much space as the city.
        There were some funny-looking city dwellers releasing new <b>dragons</b> into the machine, dragons of all sizes flying inside it, 
        doing their own chores systematically to make the machine work.
        </p>
        <p>
        It had everything Kitty was in love with: machines, magic and dragons. She couldn't hold back herself from exploring this strange city further.   
        She came to know that the funny-looking people were called the <b>code-knitters</b> and they could write magical spells to summon new dragons that they
        added to the machine to make it better.
        Intrigued by the prospect of summoning her own <b>dragon</b>, Kitty delved into the world of <b>code-knitters</b>.

            The code-knitters lived harmoniously in their city called "<b>Repositown</b>", knitting the spells together.  
            Kitty also learned that these code-knitters were always on 
            the lookout for new members to join their ranks and contribute to the summoning 
            of even mightier dragons. Sometimes, some of the existing dragons fell ill and they could also use some help to treat them as well.
            </p>
            <p>
            Each Repositown had a special book called <b>The Golden Book</b>. It contained all the spells that had summoned the dragons and the code-knitters used
            these spells to control the dragons
            above -- changing any spell in the Golden Book would change how the dragons behaved. A code-knitter could summon a dragon only if they were
             able to add their magic spell to the Golden Book of the Repositown.

            Everything was new and exciting for Kitty and she wanted explore the Repositown further. All of the code-knitters were friendly and
            she was given a <b>handbook-to-read</b> to find helpful information about the Repositown and the dragons.
            She found out that the code-knitters had a tradition of gathering regularly in large <b>forums</b> to discuss 
            spells, dragons, their health and other magical matters. Though warmly welcomed into the group, 
            Kitty found it a bit challenging to grasp the complexities of their discussions. 
            Undeterred, she decided to navigate the new city, acknowledging that some 
            tasks would indeed be complex for her.

        Determined, Kitty sought the guidance of a <b>mentor</b> who taught new citizens of the city.
        He showed her the most treasured Golden Codebook of the Repositown and guided her on the process of finding the category of spells 
        that matched her interests.
        Along with sharing his wisdom, he also advised her to go through the chronicles kept in the city's library.
        Soon, Kitty was diving deep into the <b>history of the Golden Codebook</b>
        and document outlining the <b>behaviors expected</b> in the city. He also emphasized she should try to understand the 
        spells already existing in Golden Codebook
         to enhance her chances of summoning mightier dragons.

            The library had so much information about the city, the machine and the dragons. Kitty couldn't stop herself from diving in more deeper.
             The most helpful ones for her were the <b>documents</b> describing the spells in the Golden Codebook. As she went through the spells,
             she realized that it could be easier for her to find the mistakes in the spells rather than create new spells, at least for the beginning for 
             her journey. But what could go so wrong in the spells that made those mighty dragons ill?
             </p>
             <p> 
             Fortunately, she found a catalog of these <b>issues</b>. The issues ranged from simple to complex based on the illness of the dragons.
             The code-knitters were thoughtful enough to categorize them so that code-knitters of all skill range could help to solve them.

            Staying with the mentor, Kitty learned the intricacies of the Golden Codebook. The most shocking event
            in her whole journey was when he told her that the no new citizen can add any new pages to the 
            Golden Codebook.
            How was she supposed to add spells to the Golden Codebook to summon the dragon if she could't add any
            pages to the Golden Codebook?
            </p>
            <p>
                The mentor was delighted by the brilliance of her question. The answer was that the Golden Codebook
                already had magical pages that could hold infinite spells but the spells could be added only via the 
                <b>Silver Codebook</b>.
                The Silver Codebook was an exact replica of the Golden Codebook but 
            adding magic spells there didn't really summon a dragon. However, she could create new pages in the Silver
            Codebook and later ask the mentor or any other elders to add those spells to the Golden Book.

            Kitty was very glad when she received a Silver Codebook where she could make her changes but making changes in
            Silver started becoming a bit unwieldy as there were a lots of hit and trials in the beginning. To solve that
            problem, Kitty got an idea. She would <b>clone</b> the Silver Codebook to a <b>Wooden Codebook</b> and make changes there.
            The wood was a perfect material to experiment upon, handy and she could carry it anywhere. 
            When she felt satisfied with a new spell in the Wooden Codebook, she could then update
            the Silver Codebook with those changes.

            After getting the hang of the different books, Kitty wanted to focus on solving the issues of the Repositown
            to win the favor of the elders and other fellow code-knitters.
            Most problems were deeply magical and incomprehensible for her level, but Kitty stumbled upon 
            a few that she could understand and solve. Excited at the prospect of obtaining 
            her own dragon, she picked a manageable issue, consulted fellow code-knitters, and 
            tirelessly experimented in her wooden codebook. After a long trial, it finally seemed 
            to work, her <b>first magic spell</b>.

            <p>
        Confident in her new spell, Kitty <b>updated the changes</b> in a new page of her Silver Codebook.
        She then made a <b>request to merge</b> her spells to the Golden Codebook. An elder
        meticulosly checked her spells and finally obliged to merge her request.
        A small whirl of wind appeared above Kitty and just like that, Kitty now had her small, exquisite pet
         <b>dragon</b>. 
         </p>
         <p> She was delighted but her ambitions flew higher than her pet dragon.
             She now wanted to aim for something grander and set her sights on acquiring even bigger and more powerful dragons 
         in the enchanting world of code-knitters. The journey of Kitty, the aspiring code-knitter,
          had only just begun.
