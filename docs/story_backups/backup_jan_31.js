        Once upon a time in the mystical land, there lived a curious and determined girl named Kitty who was in love with books, 
        magic and mythical creatures. 
        One day, she stumbled upon a fascinating book about dragons, the secrets of the code-knitters and their magical spells. 
        Intrigued by the prospect of summoning her own <b>ice-dragon</b>, Kitty delved into the world of <b>code-knitters</b>.

            The code-knitters, a unique species, possessed the power to create <b>spells</b> and summon magnificent dragons. 
            They lived harmoniously in their tiny kingdoms called "<b>Codelands</b>", knitting the spells together.  
            Kitty also learned that these code-knitters were always on 
            the lookout for new members to join their ranks and contribute to the summoning 
            of even mightier dragons. Each Codeland had a special book called <b>The Golden Book</b>. It was not enough for a code-knitter
             to create new magical spells to summon a dragon. They could summon one only if they were
             able to add their magic spell to the Golden Book of the Codeland.

            As she dived deeper and deeper into the book, she became more and more eager to summon a pet dragon of herself.
            She realized that she now had to become a citizen of one of the <b>Codeland</b> kingdoms soon.
            </p>
            <p>
             She traveled through the Codelands, observing the dragons they were summoning. As she had guessed, it was hard 
             to find Codelands that summoned ice dragons like she wanted. After a long and tiring journey, she decided to rest
             on the top of a hill. Little did she know that she was in for a pleasant surprise.
             </p>
             <p>
             She was flabbergasted by what she could saw from there -- there were code-knitters riding huge ice dragons and
             circling a fortified city full of hustle and bustle. She could see the whole <b>layout</b> of the city where the
             code-knitters were assembling in groups and working furiously to summon bigger dragons.
             After all the hardships, she had finally found her Codeland.

            Kitty was excited and wasted no time to explore the Codeland. All of the code-knitters were friendly and
            she was given a <b>handbook</b> that she read to find helpful information about the Codeland and the dragons.
            She found out that the code-knitters had a tradition of gathering in large <b>forums</b> to discuss 
            spells, dragons, and other magical matters. Though warmly welcomed into the group, 
            Kitty found it a bit challenging to grasp the complexities of their discussions. 
            Undeterred, she decided to navigate the new kingdom, acknowledging that some 
            tasks would indeed be complex for her.

        Determined, Kitty sought the guidance of a <b>mentor</b> who taught new citizens. 
        He  welcomed her and showed her the treasured Golden Codebook of the Codeland.
        He also provided insights into the <b>history of the codebook</b>
        and the <b>behaviors expected</b> in the kingdom. He emphasized the importance of
        understanding the spells already existing in Golden Codebook created by fellow code-knitters
         to enhance her chances of summoning mightier dragons.

            Venturing into the kingdom, Kitty experienced both ecstasy and nervousness. 
            Her love for book and her curiousness drove her to the library of the kingdom.
             There, she devoured the books, the <b>scriptures</b> describing the spells in the Golden Codebook
              and also discovered that even the kingdom of code-knitters
              faced problems â€” there were <b>issues</b> in the codebook and the dragons could have used some
              more finessing. She found a huge catalog of these issues.

            Staying with the mentor, Kitty learned the intricacies of the Golden Codebook. The most shocking event
            in her whole journey was when he told her that the no new citizen can add any new pages to the 
            Golden Codebook.
            How was she supposed to add spells to the Golden Codebook to summon the dragon if she could't add any
            pages to the Golden Codebook?
            </p>
            <p>
                The mentor was delighted by the brilliance of her question. The answer was that the Golden Codebook
                already had magical pages that could hold infinite spells but the spells could be added only via the 
                <b>Silver Codebook</b>.
                The Silver Codebook was an exact replica of the Golden Codebook but 
            adding magic spells there didn't really summon a dragon. However, she could create new pages in the Silver
            Codebook and later ask the mentor or any other elders to add those spells to the Golden Book.

            Kitty was very glad when she received a Silver Codebook where she could make her changes but making changes in
            Silver started becoming a bit unwieldy as there were a lots of hit and trials in the beginning. To solve that
            problem, Kitty got an idea. She would <b>clone</b> the Silver Codebook to a <b>Wooden Codebook</b> and make changes there.
            The wood was a perfect material to experiment upon, handy and she could carry it anywhere. 
            When she felt satisfied with a new spell in the Wooden Codebook, she could then update
            the Silver Codebook with those changes.

            After getting the hang of the different books, Kitty wanted to focus on solving the issues of the Codeland
            to win the favor of the elders and other fellow code-knitters.
            Most problems were deeply magical and incomprehensible for her level, but Kitty stumbled upon 
            a few that she could understand and solve. Excited at the prospect of obtaining 
            her own dragon, she picked a manageable issue, consulted fellow code-knitters, and 
            tirelessly experimented in her wooden codebook. After a long trial, it finally seemed 
            to work, her <b>first magic spell</b>.

            <p>
        Confident in her new spell, Kitty <b>updated the changes</b> in a new page of her Silver Codebook.
        She then made a <b>request to merge</b> her spells to the Golden Codebook. An elder
        meticulosly checked her spells and finally obliged to merge her request.
        A small whirl of wind appeared above Kitty and just like that, Kitty now had her small, exquisite pet
         <b>dragon</b>. 
         </p>
         <p> She was delighted but her ambitions flew higher than her pet dragon.
             She now wanted to aim for something grander and set her sights on acquiring even bigger and more powerful dragons 
         in the enchanting world of code-knitters. The journey of Kitty, the aspiring code-knitter,
          had only just begun.
